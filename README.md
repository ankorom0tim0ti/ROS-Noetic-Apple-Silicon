# ros-noetic-docker
This repository provides a Dockerfile to run ROS Noetic (ROS1 distribution for Ubuntu 20.04) as a Docker virtual environment on Apple Silicon Mac ( Mac OS >= 15.3.2), based on FROM arm64v8/ros:noetic-perception-focal.

The advantage of the Docker module provided by this repository is that it makes building and running Docker containers easy through submodule management using shell scripts.

*This is my first time making Dockerfile, so please feel free to submit pull requests for any improvements or corrections.*

## Note
- The host's "noetic" directory and the Docker's ~/noetic directory are shared.

- When running, the privileged option is provided, so devices like USBs can be used just like on the host.

- First build takes about 10 min.

## Usage
0. For those new to Docker, please refer to the following link to install Docker Engine:
   `https://docs.docker.com/engine/install`
1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone git@github.com:Michi-Tsubaki/ros-noetic-docker.git
   cd ros-noetic-docker
   ```
2. Build the Docker image:
   ```
   ./noetic_docker_build.sh
   ```
3. Run the Docker Container:
   ```
   xhost +
   ./noetic_docker_run.sh
   ```
4. Duplicate the Docker Container terminal:
   ```
   ./noetic_docker_attach.sh
   ```
    (â†‘ when you use rviz, rqt_reconfigure, rostopic echo,..., run command above after devide terminal screen.)

## Feature of this Dockerfile / Docker Container
This Dockerfile is designed to set up a development environment based on the ROS Noetic distribution, using the `noetic-desktop-full` image as its base. It installs a variety of essential packages for ROS development, including Python tools, SSH, and several ROS-related packages.

### 1. ROS Noetic Packages
- **`ros-noetic-roseus`**: A package for interfacing with ROS using the Lisp programming language (EusLisp).
- **`ros-noetic-pr2eus`**: A package specifically for interacting with the PR2 robot hardware using EusLisp.
- **`ros-noetic-jskeus`**: A package for interacting with JSK Robotics projects using EusLisp.
- **`ros-noetic-realsense2-camera`**: A package for integrating Intel RealSense cameras with ROS for depth sensing.
- **`ros-noetic-realsense2-description`**: Provides the URDF descriptions for RealSense devices.
- **`ros-noetic-ddynamic-reconfigure`**: Enables real-time configuration of parameters through dynamic reconfiguration.
- **`ros-noetic-catkin-virtualenv`**: A tool for creating isolated Python virtual environments for ROS packages.
- **`ros-noetic-joint-trajectory-controller`**: A package for controlling robot joints with trajectories.
- **`ros-noetic-jsk-tools`, `ros-noetic-jsk-recognition`, `ros-noetic-jsk-recognition-msgs`**: Tools for robot perception, including recognition and sensor data message definitions.
- **`ros-noetic-ridgeback-control`**: A package related to controlling the Ridgeback robot.
- **`ros-noetic-urdfdom-py`**: A package for interacting with URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) models in Python.

### 2. Workspace Setup
- The Dockerfile creates a catkin workspace (`catkin_ws`) and initializes it using `catkin_init_workspace`.
- After initializing the workspace, it builds the workspace with `catkin build`.
- Two GitHub repositories are cloned and integrated into the workspace:
  - **`ddynamic_reconfigure`**: Cloned from the official repository and built.
  - **`catkin_virtualenv`**: Cloned from Locus Robotics and built.
- Both repositories are cloned to `/root/catkin_ws/src` and the workspace is rebuilt after integration.

### 3. Additional Features
- **SSH Setup**: The Dockerfile creates a `/root/.ssh` directory and sets proper permissions, potentially useful for SSH access.
- **NVIDIA GPU Support**: The Dockerfile sets the environment variables `NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` and `NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES`, indicating potential use of NVIDIA GPUs for graphical rendering or other tasks.
- **Automatic ROS Environment Setup**: The ROS setup script and the catkin workspace setup script are automatically sourced in the `.bashrc` file, ensuring the ROS environment is ready when a new terminal session is started.
